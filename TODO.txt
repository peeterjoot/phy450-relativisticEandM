  These notes use a swapped latin/greek index convention everywhere!

   For example, I'd "corrected":

      \begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsL11:170}
      F_{\alpha\beta} = - \epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma} B_\gamma.
      \end{equation}

   but then reverted it, since that would have made it inconsistent with everything else.

- Remove review sections to simplify chapter layout.

- This set of notes needs a very thorough walk through and cleanup.

- Dead reference commented out:

   gabook:stokesNoTensor

  I purged that chapter from gabook.  Is any of the stuff that references it valid?  

- Dead url:

@webpage{ nasaGPS,
   author = "unknown",
   title = "How does GPS work",
   year = "2011",
   url = "http://www.nasm.si.edu/gps/work.html",
   note = "[Online; accessed 24-Jan-2011]"
 }

- Don't think I ever did any figures for this class.  Unfortunately too much work to retrofit them.

- Exersize env:
  o   change part (.) references to hyperlinks.
  o   use makeoproblem to mark with original problem set numbers and parts.

- Incorporate my little arxiv paper content as an appendix.

- Undef:

   LaTeX Warning: Hyper reference `path:phy450:RelEMp53.1.pdf' on page 103 undefined on input line 17.

   removed reference -- but issue may have been that I needed to track something else in the generated poppitz.tex

- remove review sections to simplify chapter layout.

- this set of notes needs a very thorough walk through and cleanup.

- dead reference commented out:

   gabook:stokesNoTensor

  I purged that chapter from gabook.  Is any of the stuff that references it valid?  

- dead url:

@webpage{ nasaGPS,
   author = "unknown",
   title = "How does GPS work",
   year = "2011",
   url = "http://www.nasm.si.edu/gps/work.html",
   note = "[Online; accessed 24-Jan-2011]"
 }

- Don't think I ever did any figures for this class.  Unfortunately too much work to retrofit them.

- exersize env:
  o   change part (.) references to hyperlinks.
  o   use makeoproblem to mark with original problem set numbers and parts.

- incorporate my little arxiv paper content as an appendix.

- undef:

LaTeX Warning: Hyper reference `path:phy450:RelEMp53.1.pdf' on page 103 undefined on input line 17.

These are my personal lecture notes for the Spring 2011, University of Toronto, Relativistic Electrodynamics course (PHY450H1S).  This class was taught by Prof. Erich Poppitz, and TA'ed by Simon Freedman.

Official course description was:

   "Special Relativity, four-vector calculus and relativistic notation, the relativistic Maxwell's Equations, electromagnetic waves in vacuum and conducting and non-conducting materials, electromagnetic radiation from point charges and systems of charges."

The text for the course was Landau and Lifshitz's "The Classical Theory of Fields", of which we used the first half.

This book contains a few things
- My lecture notes.
- Some notes from reading of the text.
- Some assigned problems.

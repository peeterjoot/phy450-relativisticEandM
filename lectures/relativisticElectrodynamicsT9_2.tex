\section{A problem from Griffiths}

FIXME: try this.

Two charges \(q+\), \(q-\) reflected in a plane, separated by distance \(a\).  Work out the stress energy tensor from the Coulomb fields of the charges on the plane.

Will get the Coulomb force:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relativisticElectrodynamicsT9:330}
\BF = k \frac{q^2}{2 a^2}.
\end{equation}
